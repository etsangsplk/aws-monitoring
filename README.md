# aws-monitoring
This repo contains helper scripts to:
 * Push custom metrics to AWS cloudwatch, and create alarms on them
 * Create Route 53 health check for given URLs and create CloudWatch alarms to notify if the URL is down

Please send a pull request if you want to contribute more scripts. We will keep adding more from time to time.
